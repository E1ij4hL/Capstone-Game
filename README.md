Two options for running the project, downloading Electron and dragging the files over (harder) or using the live server extension in Visual Studio Code (easier).

When you download the files you will have to unzip the assets folder.

Also if this is the first time running the game you might have to press the wipe button on the level select screen to initialize the level scores to empty.

Controls
  - A, D, J, L keys for the first 4 levels
  - All letter keys for the 5th level
